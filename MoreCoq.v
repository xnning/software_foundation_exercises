Theorem silly1 : forall(n m o p : nat),
     n = m ->
     [n;o] = [n;p] ->
     [n;o] = [m;p].
Proof.
  intros n m o p eq1 eq2.

  (* At this point, we could finish with
     "rewrite â†’ eq2. reflexivity." as we have
     done several times above. But we can achieve the
     same effect in a single step by using the
     apply tactic instead: *)

Theorem silly2 : forall(n m o p : nat),
     n = m ->
     (forall(q r : nat), q = r -> [q;o] = [r;p]) ->

Proof.

     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.

  rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2. reflexivity. Qed.

Theorem trans_eq : forall(X:Type) (n m o : X),
  n = m -> m = o -> n = o.
Proof.
  intros X n m o eq1 eq2. rewrite -> eq1. rewrite -> eq2.
  reflexivity. Qed.

Example trans_eq_example' : forall(a b c d e f : nat),
     [a;b] = [c;d] ->
     [c;d] = [e;f] ->
     [a;b] = [e;f].
Proof.
  intros a b c d e f eq1 eq2.
  (* If we simply tell Coq apply trans_eq at this point,
     it can tell (by matching the goal against the
     conclusion of the lemma) that it should instantiate X
     with [nat], n with [a,b], and o with [e,f].
     However, the matching process doesn't determine an
     instantiation for m: we have to supply one explicitly
     by adding with (m:=[c,d]) to the invocation of
     apply. *)
